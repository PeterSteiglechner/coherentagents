Get data for the model:
Download the dataset of ESS Wave 9 (2018) from http://doi.org/10.21338/NSD-ESS9-2018 in csv format. 
Use the data processing script to produce country folders with items.csv and correlations.csv
Grouping can be build using correlational class analysis (http://doi.org/10.15195/v4.a15, R package corclass) or relational class analysis (https://doi.org/10.1086/657976, R package RCA).
